# match-assignment

This is my solution for the MVPmatch code challenge.

Currently, it's deployed to my VPS: https://match.hmnv.me/

Swagger docs are available at https://match.hmnv.me/, but they are not very useful right now.

It's better to use the Postman collection, which is accessible via the link: https://www.postman.com/collections/d00ca51842e383856c6a
